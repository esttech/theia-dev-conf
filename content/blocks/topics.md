This conference is intended to focus on Theia from different perspectives, including but not limited to the following:

 - Core Theia platform architecture
 - Theia extenders/users (e.g. Eclipse Che)

We are now accepting proposals for talks about these topics and other topics you may suggest. The Theia Developer Conference is a great opportunity to gather the Theia Developer community and make some key decisions for Theiaâ€™s future.
